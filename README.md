# 🏰 Age of Agents

**Watch your AI coding sessions grow a peaceful pixel-art realm.**

Every Claude Code or Codex session becomes a settler walking out of the keep.
The tool it runs decides which workshop it visits, subagents become workers,
and tokens fill the storehouse — a calm, Age-of-Empires-style kingdom of your work.
No combat, just a quiet realm you can watch at a glance.

## ✨ What is this?

Age of Agents (npm package **`age-of-agents`**) runs as a small local web app
alongside your normal CLI workflow. It watches your agent session transcripts and
renders them as a calm, real-time strategy realm:

- **Each session → a settler.** Start a Claude Code or Codex session and a settler walks out of the keep, carrying your prompt as its task.
- **Tools → workshops.** The settler heads to the building that matches the work — the forge for code edits, the mage tower for web research, the mine for the terminal.
- **Subagents → workers.** When a session spawns subagents (e.g. the Task tool), they appear as little workers around their settler.
- **Tokens → harvest.** Tokens read and produced fill the storehouse. Settlers ponder while thinking, rest when waiting, and stroll home when the day's work is done.
- **Two worlds.** Switch between a **fantasy** (top-down) and a **sci-fi** (isometric) realm on the fly.

A glanceable, second-monitor view of what your agents are quietly up to.

## 🚀 Quick start

Run it instantly, no install:

```bash
npx age-of-agents          # watches ~/.claude & ~/.codex sessions, prints the URL
npx age-of-agents --demo   # calm demo mode (fake sessions)
npx age-of-agents --open   # also open the browser
```

Or install globally (commands `age-of-agents` and the shorter `aoa`):

```bash
npm i -g age-of-agents
aoa --open
```

> The server binds to `127.0.0.1` only and never writes your transcripts anywhere — it just reads them locally and broadcasts game state over a local WebSocket. See [Privacy](#-privacy).

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentsmill/age-of-agents
cd age-of-agents && npm install
npm run demo     # server (demo) + client (Vite) → http://localhost:5173
npm run dev      # visualize your real sessions
```

## 🧭 How it works

```
agent session transcript ──▶ server (watcher + state machine) ──▶ WebSocket ──▶ client (PixiJS realm + HUD)
```

- The **server** tails JSONL transcripts, turns each line into a `Fact`, and runs a small per-session **state machine** (thinking / working / resting / idle / returning).
- It broadcasts a `HeroSnapshot` for every session over a WebSocket. The snapshot carries *what* the session is doing (`currentTool`, recent actions, tokens) — never raw coordinates.
- The **client** decides *where* each settler goes and renders the pixel-art realm, the HUD, the minimap and the side panel.

## 🎨 Themes

Two full art sets, switchable from the top bar:

- **Fantasy** — top-down: keep, mage tower, library, guild, market, mine, orchard & ponds.
- **Sci-Fi** — isometric: command center, hangars, drone factory, ore refinery, research lab on a calm Martian colony.

## 🧱 Architecture

A small npm-workspaces monorepo, published as the single `age-of-agents` CLI:

| Package | Stack | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `packages/shared` | TypeScript | WebSocket protocol types (`GameEvent`, snapshots) |
| `packages/server` | Node + Fastify + `ws` | transcript watcher, state machine, hooks endpoint, demo generator, CLI |
| `packages/client` | Vite + React 19 + PixiJS v8 | the game realm, HUD, minimap, side panel |

```bash
npm test      # unit tests (server + client)
npm run build # production client + bundled CLI (dist/cli.js)
```

## 🔒 Privacy

- The server listens on `127.0.0.1` only — nothing is exposed to your network.
- Transcripts are read **locally and read-only**; their contents are never written to disk by Age of Agents or sent anywhere.
- Installing the optional Claude Code hooks modifies `~/.claude/settings.json` (a fast event channel). Demo mode touches nothing of yours.

## 🎭 Assets

All pixel-art assets in `packages/client/public/assets/` were **generated by the author with [PixelLab](https://pixellab.ai)** and are the author's own work — released here under the same MIT license as the code. Without any assets the game still runs on procedurally generated placeholders.

`assets-manifest.json` + `scripts/download-assets.mjs` are an **optional** helper for swapping in alternative third-party packs locally; those packs are never committed (some forbid redistribution) and are not needed to run the game.

## 🤝 Contributing

Issues and PRs are welcome. To get going: `npm install`, then `npm run demo` to see the realm, and `npm test` before opening a PR.
